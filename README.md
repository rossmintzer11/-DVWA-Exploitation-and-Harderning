# DVWA-Exploitation-and-Harderning
Cyber Security Homework where I exploited DVWA's vulnerabilities and provided recomendations for hardening


### Exploit Application 1: Your Wish is My Command Injection

#### Command Injection Example:

#### Mitigation Startegies
The first strategy to mitigate DVWA's command injection vulnerability is fix the access control for the www user. The www user is the user used for web traffic. Since this can be anybody accessing the web-page, The Least Privledge principle should be applied and the www user should only have access to commands and files neccessary for proper usage of the web page. In this case, the only priveledge the internet user needs is access to the ping command  and read-only(4) permision on the files neccessary to view the web page. Further, to prevent the command injection use of input sanitation and illegal characters is a great solution. In this example, programming the input to only accept numbers, periods, and a max length of 15 characters (forn 1 ip) else return an error should work.
